Earth's climate has been closely monitored for the past century with direct measurements and observation of climate components such as precipitation and temperature. Analyzing past climate records is a more difficult endeavor due to the lack of such direct data. In order to reconstruct past climate conditions, scientists must rely on various proxies that are sensitive to climatic and environmental changes. Such proxies may be oxygen and hydrogen isotopes preserved in ice cores or fossil remains from marine organisms such as belemnites or foraminifera, preserved in the geological record. 

## Milankovitch Cycles

In the 19th century, a geologist named Jean Louis Aggasiz made several observations based on glacial deposits which indicated the presence of a massive ice sheet which covered much of Europe. This raised many questions, such as what are the factors that control the coming and going of ice ages. In the 20th century however, a Serbian scientist named Milutin Milankovitz proposed and explanation for the climatic shifts that control the ice ages. He argued that the changes are likely due to variations in the Earth's orbit around the sun, which controls insolation, the amount of energy received from the sun. These cycles were thereafter called Milankovich cycles.

Milankovich defined three key parameters for orbital cycle calculations: eccentricity, obliquity and the precession of the spin axis.
