My name is Adrian. I am a graduate geoscientist and Python Developer. I finished my Bachelor of Science in Geology at the University of Babes Bolyai from Cluj-Napoca, Romania in 2017. I graduated Geology-Geoscience (MSc) at the University of Copenhagen on November 30th 2020.

I have always had an interest for Earth Science and all matters related to IT. With the geological industries evoling at a rapid rate, I believe that programming will become an essential skill for every geoscientist. Object-oriented programming unlocks unique ways to interpret data and provides enhanced data visualization tools for researchers.

Python has caught my attention since 2017 and I have been teaching myself new tricks in this language ever since. The Python packages have many applications in Geoscience and I found them very useful for my projects. If you have similar interests, stay tuned for I will share many articles, projects and tutorials on this website.

With that being said, I am not exactly a Computer Scientist, and English is not my mother language. If you notice any mistakes with my scripts and you wish to send me suggestions, know that they are most welcome.
